# Summary

A simple cat toy that can be filled with kibble.  Cats kick it around, it rolls and occasionally dispenses a cat treat.  It consists of a cylinder with small perforations so that the food contained within can be seen, heard, and smelled.  It also contains one large hole that acts as the dispensing mechanism.  The hole diameter (in relation to the size of the treats inside) and the overall length of the tube dictate how easily a piece of food will drop out.

Designed for Science Diet dry cat food.  Alter the dispensing hole diameter (a constant in the OpenSCAD source) for other food/treat sizes.

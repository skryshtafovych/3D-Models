This Was printed in order to replace My Z-5500 speaker knob.

# Summary

A replacement knob for my logitech Z5500 speakers, because the old one broke. this one is way more sturdy, yet feels very smooth.
you will probably need plyers to remove it, it doesn't require glue. 
should in theory fit any regular potentiometer
